1ai0: is a nice example for it's a divers molecular system.
    - Mol.Sys.  - 2 models (truncated to for speed reason)
                - 12 proteins (chains)
                - 6 ligands
                - 2 water molecules
                - 2 zinc ions
                - for in total 12 chains; the ligands, water and zinc is
                    not part of any chain.
     - Restraints   - 4391 various distance restraints of which 4239 were linked in
                        DOCR (part of the NMR Restraints Grid).
                    - TODO: actually add them to the project.
