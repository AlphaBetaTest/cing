#summary Step by step instruction on Mac

== Mac version ==
{{{
Steps taken on duvel.cmbi.ru.nl (4 core MacBook Pro 15-inch, Mid 2010): OSX 10.8
8 GB RAM with SSD
Order below matters.
}}}

== Install Mac Ports ==

Start from a clean install from:
From http://www.macports.org/

== Turn off spotlight to speed processing up ==
{{{
sudo launchctl unload  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist
}}}

== Install mandatory deps ==

=== Done in 5 minutes gawk as test and also my whole .cshrc inits depend on it  ===
{{{
sudo port install gawk
}}}

=== Optionally switch doing [https://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/ParallelBuilding multiple] make jobs ===
{{{
sudo vi /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf
}}}
Set to zero:
buildmakejobs           0

With top you can see the load on the machine increasing from 1 to a max of 4 (on 8 cores) during subsequent builds.

===Done in 5 minutes, set python26 selected early on ===
{{{
sudo port install python26 python_select 
port select --set python python26  
}}}

===Now the matplotlib MONSTER ===
This is going to install gcc so it will take about 5 hours. Mostly being stuck on [http://x4350.blogspot.com/2011/06/building-atlas-on-macports-takes.html atlas].
{{{
port install py27-matplotlib +tkinter +gtk2
}}}

Note that I had to force the activation since there were already installs in /Applications/MacPorts. Starting on August 2012 with Lion, python26 failed to compile on objc or something so I switched to python27 everywhere here.

===Done in 10 minutes. Smaller python deps.===
{{{
port install py27-curl py27-mysql py27-sqlalchemy py27-psycopg2 py27-scipy py27-ipython
}}}

===Done in 15 minutes OPTIONAL===
{{{
port install pymol xeyes p7zip Pallet py27-readline szip unrar
}}}

===Jenkins related installs, pretty fast. OPTIONAL===
{{{
port install sloccount py27-lint py27-nose py27-coverage
}}}
Rename to version aspecifics for easy of code maintenance.===
{{{
    cd /opt/local/bin
    sudo ln -s coverage-2.7    coverage
    sudo ln -s nosetests-2.7   nosetests
    sudo ln -s pylint-2.7      pylint
}}}

===More installs for CING (provides convert and ps2pdf)===
{{{
port install povray ghostscript ImageMagick
}}}

From here you should follow the generalized [SetupCING]
