How to setup 'shared folders' in VC

= Introduction =

Shared folders allow the guest OS (Ubuntu in VirtualCING) to use directories of the host OS. Enabling 'shared folders' in VMware Player is however not enough to properly configure this feature. The installation of Vmware Tools in VC is also required. Follow the steps below and host directories will be visible in /mnt/hgfs/ of VC.
