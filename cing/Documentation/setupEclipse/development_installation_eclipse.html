<title>How to install CING for development on Eclipse</title>
</head>
<body>
Install the requirements:<br><br>
<ol>
<li><b>Install Fink</b>
<br>Make sure you have the unstable trees in your fink.conf too. I had to add:
        <PRE>/unstable/main and /unstable/fink </PRE>
 and do: <PRE>fink selfupdate</PRE>
 <li><b>Install Biggle plotting utilities</b>
<pre>fink install biggles-py25</pre>
 Note that this also installs the python 2.5 plotlib and numeric dependencies.

 <li><b>Install  IPython</b>
 <pre>fink install ipython-py25</pre></li>

<li><b>Setup Eclipse</b><BR>
Always start from command line instead of Dock/Taskbar so that it gets your environment settings such as
PRODIR for the PROCHECK_NMR installation.<br>
CING is being developed on Eclipse 3.3 with PyDev Extensions for automatic code analysis and organization.
<LI><b>Setup CVS archive</b><BR>
Register with sourceforge to get a user account. Check out the CING project from CVS in Eclipse. <br>
This is a two wizard step process; first the CVS then the Pydev wizard.<br><br>

<li><b>Project tree</b>
<br>The project tree with the python code expanded should look something like:<br>

<Br>
<li><b>PYTHONPATH inside Eclipse</b>
<br>Add the local python dir to your PYTHONPATH inside Eclipse. The CCPN is mandatory
but the Wattos python dir is really optional.
