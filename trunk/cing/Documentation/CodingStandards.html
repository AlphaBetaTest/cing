In CING, the python coding standards set forth here were attempted:
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
<P>
With the following exceptions
<ol>
<li>
<b>Annotations</b> for Pydev Extensions such as: are included. 
Settings for Pydev Extensions: turn off checking for inconsistent spacing because
it drives JFD crazy.
<li>
<b>Documentation Strings 
</b>
No leading space.<li>
<b>Package and Module Names</b>
Caps are allowed. Few underscores used.
<li><b>Function Names</b>
Again, Caps are used instead of underscores.
<li><b>Line width</b>
JFD sometimes prefers exceeding 80 characters per line.
</ol>

And the additions:

<ol>
<li>
No brackets for simple if block.
<li>
Extra #end if comments for -long- sections but not for single line ifs or fors.
</ol>

Special care:
No "import string" because always using string methods directly for speed.
