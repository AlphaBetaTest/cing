Design considerations:

Definitions contained MolDef, ResidueDef, AtomDef, DihedralDef classes
Export to pyhton-readable code;
  Methods: printit()

Import/export of atom naming conventions from/to flat-atom table file is possible:
  to faciltate updating
  Methods: MolDef.importNameDefs( fileName )
           Moldef.exportNameDefs( fileName )

Internal naming is essential and cannot be changed easily
Internally now use CYANA nomenclature (from cyana.lib):
- closest to IUPAC but complete in its table,
- plus HN rather then H, and 'Q' rather then 'M' for methyls is preferable.
- Note that for Gly CYANA uses HA1,HA2 and BMRB uses HA2,HA3!! Other than that, the stereo
  nomenclature is the same (I think).

First atom table list generated from
  cyana.lib
  protein translation table of BMRB
  rna.pdb from BMRB
  dna.pdb from BMRB
Script: mkatomTable.py > file atomTable.def

Edited DNA/RNA entries atomTable.def manually

Used atomTable.def and cyana.lib data to generate first residueDefs database structure
Script: mkresidueDefs.py > residueDefs.py

* 24 Feb 2004:
Edited aa name defs for ARG+, GLU-, ASP-, HIST, HIS+ in atomTable.def

 py updateResidueDefs.py > tmp
 mv tmp residueDefs.py

* 24 Feb 2004:
Scripts used initially now in INITIAL_SCRIPTS directory


* To Do:
Clean-up referencing: everything follwing the NTstruct dictionary method
Nomenclature atoms DNA/RNA

20-25 Sep 2005
Restructuring using NTtree and saving to different file format.
1. Read residueDefs and converted to 'keyword format': dbTable.py
2. Redefined the MolDef, ResidueDef, AtomDef and DihedralDef classes; based on
   NTtree,
   used nameDict attribute to store the different names
3. File 'NTdb.py': contains classes and parser of dbTable.
   Yields NTdb as root of database
4. Conversion dictionaries initialised from nameDict entries of NTdb

Note that updating dict and list types requires first initialisation of the
NTdb-tree and then updating it. Otherwise, the changes are discarded as parsing
the dbTable involves blunt assignment of the corresponding attributes.

28 Nov 2005:
* dbTable now contains dbTable entry: update proprams that write this table.
* Using dbTableNew, added spin system SS

* Need to update initBMRB and initDynamo.

* Need to update Peaks class and routines depending on it:
exportPeaks2Xeasy, exportPeaks2sparky, updateResonancesFromPeaks .....

20-22 Jan 2006: implementing removing residue for Mark H.
* Chain.removeResidue
* Tree.removeChild
* Tree.youngerSiblings
* Tree.olderSiblings
* General rule: all refs using instances, strings only on initializing    ...


30 Jan 2006.
Included shifts info from BMRB using the addSHIFTS.py routine.
Residues CYSS, HIS+, HIST, and DNA/RNA are not yet included.

31 Jan 2006
Major overhaul of the dictonairy routines. Removed resNameTranslations,
atomNameTranslations, resNameTable, and resName2internal routine.
Now everything works from the residueDict and atomDict dictionaries.
Defined a LOOSE convention to allow for shortname or Partially caps
residue name translation
new routines:
translateAtomName, translateResidueName, NTdbGetResidue, NTdbGetAtom

31 Jan 2006
Added ION residue, to accomodate the Ca2+ in CBD structures.

23 Feb 2006:
When importing peaks from Xeasy, I now update the peak index with the
peakid from the original file

17 April 2007: fixed error in QE topology (was SD, should be CE)
18 April 2007: changed defs QR for PHE and TYR, now similar to VAL QQG and LEU QQD
24 May   2007: Reordered dihedrals for more useful output during validation:
               PHI, PSI, CHIs, OMEGA
               Introduced PRO PHI
               Renamed ILE CHI21 to CHI2
               Added cPRO residue, CB and CG shifts from Shubert et al,
               JBNMR 24, 149-54, 2002
                CYSS as CYS with HG removed
23 Jul    2007: Changed internal name HIST into HISE
 7 Sep    2007: Changed internal name ION to CA2P, included hetatm attribute for PDB
11 Sep    2007: Added properties attribute.
25 Sep    2007: Commented irrelevant dihedral of methyl containing residues:
                ALA CHI1; ILE CHI22, CHI31 ; LEU CHI31, CHI32; MET CHI4
                THR CHI22, renamed CHI21 to CHI2; VAL CHI21, CHI22
26 Sep    2007: Gave Cyana pseudo residues the cyanaPseudoResidue property
10 Oct    2007: OMEGA IUPAC
05 Dec    2007: Renamed NTdict to NTdict
19 Dec    2007: remapped BMRB nucleic acid residue names to reflect PDB;
                  added Zn, His HE2, with BMRB map. Added nucleic prop to n.a.
11 Apr    2008: Added Aqua mappings and improved others.
29 Apr    2008: Fixed entry HIS: removed HE2, now is prot HD1; deprot HE2
30 Apr    2008: Fixed entry HISH: nameDict = { ..., 'CYANA': 'HIS+', ...}
08 May    2008: Renamed RURA to URA
15 May    2008: Defined CE1 for BRMB, AQUA in HISE
20 May    2008: BRMB, AQUA atom names for HISH
01 Jun    2008: BRMB, AQUQ residue names for LYSx, ARGx

15 Jun 2008:
For changing INTERNAL format to IUPAC
- Need to use INTERNAL everywhere rather then 'INTERNAL': ccpn plugin needs adjustment (27 Sep 08: done)
- INTERNAL will map on 'INTERNAL0' string: allows for future changes ('INTERNAL1', 'INTERNAL2') etc.
- After update: Molecule._saveSequence, _saveStereoAssignments: CYANA->INTERNAL
- old cing projects will fail on restoring peaks, restraints, etc.
- For 'alias': implemented in Residue.addAtom; update Residue.mutate

18 Jul    2008: Removed quotes ("") from Q1' and Q2' of ZN2P
