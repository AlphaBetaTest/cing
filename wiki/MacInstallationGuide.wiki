#summary Step by step instruction on Mac

== Mac version ==
{{{
Mac OS X 10.5.7 (9J61)
}}}

== Install Mac Ports ==

From http://www.macports.org/

== Install mandatory deps ==

As root do:
{{{
port install py26-matplotlib py26-ipython py26-pil py26-scipy povray imagemagick ghostscript 
}}}
Make sure the matplotlib version is at least 0.99.1.1.

I do create a soft link for the python2.6 executable as root:
{{{
cd /opt/local/bin
ln -s python2.6 python
ln -s ipython-2.6 ipython
}}}

== Install optional packages NOT NEEDED ==

=== MYSQL ===
{{{
port install py26-mysql
}}}

=== Postgres ===
{{{
port install py26-sqlalchemy py26-psycopg2
}}}
The last module will also install postgres but I don't use the port install since the Japanese pdbmlplus requires specifics in the build.
