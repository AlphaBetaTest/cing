#summary Step by step instruction on Mac

== Mac version ==
{{{
OSX 10.6.7
}}}

== Install Mac Ports ==

From http://www.macports.org/

== Install mandatory deps ==

As root do (takes several hours once gcc needs to be compiled):
{{{
port install povray imagemagick ghostscript 
}}}

{{{
sudo port install python26 python_select 
port select --set python python26   
}}}
The last line works in contrast to the line I had before:
{{{
python_select python26 
}}}

{{{
port install py26-matplotlib +tkinter +gtk2
}}}
Make sure the matplotlib version is at least 0.99.1.1. Check with: {{{port installed | grep matp}}}
Mine currently shows: py26-matplotlib @1.0.1_3+gtk2+tkinter (active)

{{{
port install py26-ipython py26-pil py26-scipy 
}}}

I do create a soft links for the python2.6 executables as root:
{{{
cd /opt/local/bin
ln -s python2.6 python
ln -s ipython-2.6 ipython
}}}
This is about the only manual 'correction' I do to my mac ports. Perhaps this causes more bads than good?

== Install optional packages besides python NOT NEEDED ==
{{{
port install pymol gawk xeyes
sudo port upgrade --enforce-variants gcc44 +gfortran
}}}
For Whatif (optional dep) the gfortran variant is needed.

== Install optional python packages NOT NEEDED ==
{{{
port install py26-curl py26-mysql py26-sqlalchemy py26-psycopg2
}}}
The py26-psycopg2 module will also install postgres but I don't use the port install since the Japanese pdbmlplus requires specifics in the build.

Not easy. Please let me know if there's an easier way to do this e.g. with homebrew?
