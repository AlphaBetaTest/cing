#summary Step by step instruction on Mac

== Mac version ==
{{{
Mac OS X 10.5.7 (9J61)
}}}

== Install Mac Ports ==

From http://www.macports.org/

== Install mandatory deps ==

As root do:
{{{
port install py26-matplotlib
port install py26-ipython
port install povray
port install imagemagick
port install ghostscript
port install py26-pil
port install py26-scipy
}}}
Make sure the matplotlib version is at least 0.99.1.1.

I do create a soft link for the python2.6 executable as root:
{{{
cd /opt/local/bin
ln -s python2.6 python
}}}

== Install optional packages NOT NEEDED ==

=== MYSQL ===
{{{
port install py26-mysql
}}}

=== Postgres ===
{{{
port install py26-sqlalchemy
port install py26-psycopg2
}}}
The last module will also install postgres but I don't use the port install since the Japanese pdbmlplus requires specifics in the build.

From here you should follow the generalized [SetupCING]
