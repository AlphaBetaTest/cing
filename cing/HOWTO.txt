 HOWTO:
- check if your installation is ok. First setup as described in REAME.txt in this directory.
    cing --test
- run procheck on a small example.
    cing -n 2hgh_small --initPDB $CINGROOT/Tests/data/2hgh_small.pdb --ipython
    project.procheck()
- convert some cyana data to cing:
    python -u $CINGROOT/python/cing/Scripts/cyana2cing.py --pdbFile $CINGROOT/Tests/data/2hgh_small
    
- print the first model's chi 1 as reported by procheck of residue 77 in chain A.
    format project.molecule.A.GLU77.procheck.CHI1[0]
    Not very useful as it's already part of cing itself; just like PHI, etc.
    format project.molecule.A.GLU77.CHI1[0] or:
    formatall( project.molecule.A.residues[0].CHI1 )
    more useful might be:
    format project.molecule.A.GLU77.procheck.secStruct
    
    NB. 
    format object
    is equivalent with 
    print object.format()
    format is a method that most of cing's objects have and that give more user friendly
    output (sometimes over multiple lines)
    
- print list of parameters:- print list of parameters:
    formatall( project.plotparameters.PHI )
    formatall( project.molecule.A.residues[0].C.coordinates )
    formatall( project.plotparameters.PHI )
    formatall( project.molecule.A.residues[0].procheck )
    formatall( project.molecule.A.VAL171.C )

FOR PROGRAMMERS:
- reload a plugin:
    cing.core.importPlugin.importPlugin("procheck") or shorthand:
    importPlugin("procheck") if defined.
    
NEW FEATURE REQUESTS:
- Where are the restraints info tables/visualizations?
- Put files in more temporary location e.g. off of /tmp instead of within project to save.
- Get global properties; in the check.db now there are only Atom and Residue props listed and there are only 51
    present. Whereas the pdbout.txt file contains over 80 check results..
- Convert Procheck postscript data to gifs as on pdbsum pages with summary info in html. Template can be 
    exactly how they did it: The Procheck analyses for 1brv as an example:
    http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/RunPROCHECK.pl?pdb=1brv
    For explanations we should refer to: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?doc=TRUE&pdbcode=n/a&template=doc_procheck.html
    after verifying with Roman.
    
    
    
- Rename $cingRoot/cing to $cingRoot/src as it confuses the heck out everything.
    Then refactor the code so that only -ONE- path needs to be added to PYTHONPATH for everything in cing.
    Now there's ${cingRoot}:${cingPath}:${cingLibs}:${refinePath}:
    parametersDict['cingPath']    = os.path.join( cingRoot, 'cing')
    parametersDict['cingLibs']    = os.path.join( cingRoot, 'Libs')
    parametersDict['refinePath']  = os.path.join( cingRoot, 'Refine')
