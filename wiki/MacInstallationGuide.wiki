#summary Step by step instruction on Mac

== Mac version ==
{{{
Mac OS X 10.5.7 (9J61)
}}}

== Install Mac Ports ==

From http://www.macports.org/

== Install mandatory deps ==

As root do:
{{{
port install py25-matplotlib
port install py25-ipython
port install povray
port install imagemagick
port install ghostscript
port install py25-pil
}}}
The only problem I had was for a download that failed at our university but worked from home.

I do create a soft link for the python2.5 executable as root:
{{{
cd /opt/local/bin
ln -s python2.5 python
}}}

From here you should follow the generalized [SetupCING]
