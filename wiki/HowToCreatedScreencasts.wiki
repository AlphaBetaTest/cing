= Publish =
{{{
- Edit with iMovie.
       - Import to the Event Library (bottom left panel). Takes time
to generate thumbnails.
       - Create a new project in the Project Library (top left panel)
       - Select and trim sections from the event library clips and
drag and drop them to the new project.
       - Add a music track from say iTunes and set the volume to like 1 %.
- Export from iMovie because it doesn't do the highest resolution.
- At YouTube
       - Enter your account info and set the category to "Science &
Technology".
       - Title like: Analysis iCing interface Screencast
       - Enter description like: "Hi, my name is Jurgen and in this
screencast I will show you how to use Analysis to validate your NMR
project with in iCing."
       - Add Tags like: CING, Analysis, NMR, Structure Validation,
Proteins, Nucleic Acids, CCPN, PDB
       - Size has to be at least 1280 x 720 (16:9 HD).
- Link to it from as many web pages as you see fit.
- I like to add a high resolution version to the CING web site since
it really is hard to read the font on YouTube.
- Closed captions can easily be created by youtubecc.
