#summary Step by step instruction on Linux

== Linux version ==
{{{
Linux version 2.6.27-11-generic (buildd@rothera) (gcc version 4.3.2 (Ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu11) ) #1 SMP Thu Jan 29 19:24:39 UTC 2009

== Install apt ==

== Install matplotlib ==

Look for version 0.98.3-1 or higher. Developed with 0.98.5-1
This installs python2.5 versions of everything on my test os; bigbird.cmbi.umcn.nl. This is the minimum python version: 2.5 because with the package managers 2.4 has a matplotlib that fails.

Configure matplotlib by putting the configuration file in the download section here:
{{{
http://cing.googlecode.com/files/matplotlibrc
}}}
in a directory that might already be created:
{{{
~/..matplotlib/matplotlibrc
}}}

== Install other deps ==
{{{
ImageMagick.x86_64
wings-povray.x86_64 # or something like povray UNTESTED.
}}}

== Configure CING ==

First setup CING proper as described in $CINGROOT/README.txt using a Makefile.

If you don't have access to '/tmp/cing' then configure a local tmp path by doing something like:
{{{
echo "cingDirTmp             = '/home/jurgen/tmp/cingTmp/'" > $CINGROOT/python/cing/localConstants.py
}}}

== Test installation ==
{{{
cing --test -v 0
}}}
or when you need the highest debug verbosity use 9 instead of 0. Normal is 3. 

== Problems with dependencies ==
If you have these it might be nice to check the installation without them. If you want to temporarily disable them then do something like:
{{{
unsetenv  xplorPath
unsetenv  procheckPath
unsetenv  aqpcPath   
unsetenv  whatifPath 
unsetenv  dsspPath   
unsetenv  molmolPath
unsetenv  povrayPath

unsetenv  convertPath
unsetenv  ghostscriptPath 
unsetenv  ps2pdfPath

setenv PYTHONPATH $CINGROOT/python:${CYTHON}                 
                  
unsetenv CLASSPATH
}}}

For more permanent changes adjust the generated $CINGROOT/cing.csh
